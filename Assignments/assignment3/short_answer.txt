Make a Class
------------

Q1. What’s const-correctness and why is it important?
Const-correctness is the practice of using the const keyword to explicitly specify which variables, parameters, and member functions should not modify the state of an object. It includes:

Const variables: Variables that cannot be modified after initialization

Const parameters: Function parameters that promise not to modify the passed object

Const member functions: Methods that promise not to modify the object's state (don't change member variables)

Why it's important:

Compiler enforcement: The compiler catches accidental modifications at compile time

Self-documenting code: Makes the programmer's intent clear about what can/cannot be modified

Safer code: Prevents unintended side effects and bugs

Enables optimizations: Compiler can make better optimizations knowing certain values won't change

Better APIs: Clear contracts about what functions do and don't modify

Q2. Is your class const-correct? How do you know?
A2. 
I would compile the code and try to create const instances of my class

I would attempt to call member functions on const objects to see which ones work

I would review each member function to see if it modifies any member variables

I would check if getter/setter methods are properly marked as const/non-constYes
