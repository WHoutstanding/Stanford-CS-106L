Unique Pointer
--------------

Q1. List one or two benefits of using RAII to manage memory instead manually calling `new` and `delete`.
A1. Automatic Resource Cleanup & Exception Safety

Q2. When implementing move semantics for a `unique_ptr`, for example in the move constructor `unique_ptr(unique_ptr&& other)`, it is essential that we set the underlying pointer of the `other` parameter to `nullptr` before exiting the function. Explain in your own words what problem would arise if we did not.
A2. If we don't set other.ptr to nullptr in the move constructor, we would create a dangerous situation where two unique_ptrs believe they own the same object.

Q3. This method of recursive deallocation through RAII works great for small lists, but may pose a problem for longer lists. Why? Hint: what is the limit for how "deep" a recursive function's call stack can grow?
A3. The Issue: Limited Stack Depth

Q4. What does `std::move` do in this context? Why is it safe to use `std::move` and move semantics here?
A4. move semantics; yes;
